Thank you for using ScratchTools!

ScratchTools is a lightweight browser extension that aims to enhance the default Scratch user experience by allowing users to push past the normal limits of Scratch while still being able to host their projects on the scratch.mit.edu website. This means that there's no hacky JSON manipulation or external scripts imported from other websites to make these features possible. All features are injected and applied to the website each time the page loads. As a bonus, ScratchTools is rather snappy and won't slow down your browser.

With ScratchTools, you will be able to:
 - View projects in TurboWarp with the click of a button.
 - Run projects buttery smooth at 60 FPS in the native player.
 - Change the theme from blinding light gray and blue to dark mode that's easy on your eyes.
 - Use and view BBCode markup within comments on the website (Only ScratchTool users can see the markup).
 - Become notified of incoming messages.
 - Choose to disable script highlighting.
 - Use the TurboWarp player instead of the native Scratch player.
 - Use a custom font of your choice throughout the site.

ScratchTools pairs amazingly with Griffpatch's DevTools and Messaging Extension for an refreshed Scratch experience.

Note: ScratchTools is in development so most of the features listed above are incomplete or nonexistent so far.
